  <h1>Barcode Masters - Monster Battle Game</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Game Overview</h2>
    <p>In Barcode Masters, you scan "The Codes" â€” special barcodes that hold the DNA essence of different creatures. When you scan a Code, you unlock a unique one of a kind creature that appears with it's stats, level, and random starter name. Collect and train your creatures, then battle them to rise to the top!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scan The Code:</strong> Use your barcode scanner to unlock creatures. Each scan will give you a creature with stats, level, and experience.</li>
      <li><strong>View and Rename:</strong> Go to the Collection Manager to view your creatures, rename them, and track their progress.</li>
      <li><strong>Battle:</strong> Enter PVP battles and tournaments to test your creatures' strength against others.</li>
      <li><strong>Energy Management:</strong> Keep an eye on your energy to control when you can scan for new creatures or buy power-ups.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Energy System</h2>
    <p>Energy is used to scan new creatures. More powerful creatures require more energy to unlock. You can buy energy power-ups to help you in your journey, and be strategic with your energy usage to collect and grow the best monsters!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Creature Evolution</h2>
    <p>As your creatures battle and gain experience, they level up and evolve. They become stronger and unlock new abilities, giving you even more power in battles!</p>
